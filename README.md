Hey! My names are rusnuker and antihack3r. I mainly post source codes of mods.

I live by these rules:
```
1. Whoever obtained the source code of whatever can use it whenever and however they want.
2. A DMCA takedown is the worst thing that can happen to somebody.
3. Malware is fun, but only if it's clear that there's malware.
5. There's always something missing.
```
